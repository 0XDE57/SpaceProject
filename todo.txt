[...] fix land/take-off
    [x] position bug
    [x] time based orbit
    [x] time synced takeoff
    [...] nested orbit: consider children of children eg: satellite->moon->planet->star
    [...] clean up
    [...] genericize and make work land and take off work for AI, system doesn't supports non-player world switching
        dumb loop where AI lands on planet, kept in some kind of background
        processing state/alt engine, wait a second then take off to test all is working correctly
        background engine meant to be low processing effort (eg: ultra dumbed down AI or simulations, no rendering, no physics, just states and events) to keep track of important entities
        and states between space and worlds. eg: give entity important flag component to keep relevant, if dont have flag dont care and remove when switch
        will be useful for persistence, AI and story type events.

        eg:
        Engine backgroundEngine.
        if (player switch screen) {
            //move persistent from main to background processing
            for each entity in mainEngine {
                if (entity has PersistenceComponent) {
                    //eg: attacked an AI, AI gets TimedPersistenceComponent and will remain on planet for 5 minutes waiting for you
                    backgroundEngine.Add(entity);
                }
            }
            //move relevant entity from background processing to main
            for each entity in backgroundEngine {
                if (entity has PersistenceComponent) {
                    if (is persistence relevant to new context) {
                        //example relevance:
                        //player in space, important entity on planet
                        //if land on planet with important entity, load into actual engine
                        mainEngine.Add(entity);
                        //could be more nuanced, like perhaps entity is only loaded when event triggers it
                        //or specific location on planet. dunno till start implementing.
                        //possibly have multiple engines handling contexts?
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        if (AI switch screen) {
            //similar thing to above
            //if relevant load it, else keep in background

            //if not important, remove from engine, forget about existence
        }

[...] 3D roll animation for dodge / barrel roll
    [x] fix 3D texture test
    [x] integrate
    [...] scale bounding box during rotation
    [ ] fix take off and landing shink/grow animation
    [ ] clean up: should move values to config
    [ ] clean up: optimize rendering -> ModelCache
    [ ] mobile/touch UI way of activating dodge, a swipe on the joystick may be intuitive


[...] fix texture / map loading
    [x] seed based load instead of position
    [ ] clean up star save/load
    [x] fix thread generation to be limited (probably by core count) threadpool?
    [x] planets load from cache
    [ ] prevent generating duplicate seed when one is in process of being created but not yet created
    [ ] clean up
    [ ] bug: when play with generation settings in TestNoiseScreen, seems to effect map/tile generation in game

[ ] fix player moving ahead of camera at high speed, seem to happen only when vsync is on...

[ ] take care of some of the todo's
    there is so much to do...

[ ] fixed time step (necessary for multiplayer?)

    [ ] fix floating point errors in deep space caused by large world coordinates and small frame times is affecting movement physics: epsilon / truncating errors

    https://simonschreibt.de/gat/1nsane-carpet-2-repetitive-worlds/

[...] fix render priority (z-order)
      [X] moved into separate variable
      [ ] define proper heights for importance as current values are somewhat arbitrary

[ ] system processing priority
[ ] fix space parallax system, generating pixmaps on the fly is slow, try to replace with shader
[ ] fix ship edges to use entire width of texture
[ ] try setting camera rotate to player orientation?
[ ] simple scripting? text file of commands for creating entities and printing story text?
[ ] multiplayer/networking...or just commit suicide

---DEBUG---
[ ] in game console
[ ] messages/info/log
[ ] commands
[ ] cleanup debug UI (component list)
[ ] FPS,memory,entity graph

---MOBILE---
[ ] if player bounds overlap vehicle, show enter button on touchUI/hud
[ ] if in vehicle show exit button (if can get out? must be over platform/spacestation? jetpack?)
[ ] pinch-pull to zoom in-out on touch
[ ] test touchUI on different screen sizes/resolutions
[ ] set engine speed max to multiplier on android?

[...] combat system
	create types, (normal, red, green, blue)?
	shoot circles/rectangles with radius relative to damage "weight" of projectile (damage = size * velocity * typeMultiplier)?
	dodge [Left][Right] (double tap) - move fast to left or right
	shield [SHIFT] - ring around ship
	add side to side barrel roll dodge (jump/burst) [LEFT]/[RIGHT]
    [ ] ControllableComponent.timerDodge needs to be in VehicleComponent

[ ] engine mode:
        -combat (slow, for interacting with object near, landing planets, fighting)
        -cruise (medium, for navigating within a system, planet to planet, avoid/escape, faster travel)
        -warp   (fast, warp to other systems, can't turn, can't fight)

[ ] ship generation
	wings, engines, weapons, another layer on top for depth/windshield type thing
	look at some different types of ships like an 'H' ,etc...
	perhaps come up with some kind of classes of ships (cargo, highspeed traveler, tank/war machine, passenger, personal, commercial...)

[ ] planet generation
	research planet attributes //size, temperature, pressure, atmosphere/elements(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy)...etc
	rings around planets? (like saturn)
	moons/satellites
