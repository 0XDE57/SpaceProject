[...] fix land/take-off
    [ ] transition feels unreliable
        [ ] bug: landed on planet which had finished generating, but did't load (no map found)
            see: WorldRenderingSystem.loadMap() (also rendering shouldn't be responsible for loading...)
        [ ] bug: had an instance where take off rogue planet ended up with no ship and seemingly wrong co'ords
            see: ScreenTransitionSystem.syncLoadPosition()
    [ ] bug: shrink sometimes doesn't scale properly or at all
    [ ] pause stage is also now broken, need to reset timer
    [ ] nested orbit: consider children of children eg: satellite->moon->planet->star
    [ ] finish transistor animation, should have screen effect for polish and to hide loading/level change. goal feel a little more seamless
        (fade to white/pixelate shader during landing, load map (can wait here for a second if not finished generating, when generations finished start white then fade normal, continue)
    [...] genericize and make work land and take off work for AI, system doesn't supports non-player world switching
        dumb loop where AI lands on planet, kept in some kind of background
        processing state/alt engine, wait a second then take off to test all is working correctly
        background engine meant to be low processing effort (eg: ultra dumbed down AI or simulations, no rendering, no physics, just states and events) to keep track of important entities
        and states between space and worlds. eg: give entity important flag component to keep relevant, if dont have flag dont care and remove when switch
        will be useful for persistence, AI and story type events.

        eg:
        Engine backgroundEngine.
        if (player switch screen) {
            //move persistent from main to background processing
            for each entity in mainEngine {
                if (entity has PersistenceComponent) {
                    //eg: attacked an AI, AI gets TimedPersistenceComponent and will remain on planet for 5 minutes waiting for you
                    backgroundEngine.Add(entity);
                }
            }
            //move relevant entity from background processing to main
            for each entity in backgroundEngine {
                if (entity has PersistenceComponent) {
                    if (is persistence relevant to new context) {
                        //example relevance:
                        //player in space, important entity on planet
                        //if land on planet with important entity, load into actual engine
                        mainEngine.Add(entity);
                        //could be more nuanced, like perhaps entity is only loaded when event triggers it
                        //or specific location on planet. dunno till start implementing.
                        //possibly have multiple engines handling contexts?
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        if (AI switch screen) {
            //similar thing to above
            //if relevant load it, else keep in background

            //if not important, remove from engine, forget about existence
        }


[...] fix texture / map loading
    [x] seed based load instead of position
    [ ] clean up star save/load
    [x] fix thread generation to be limited (probably by core count) threadpool?
    [x] planets load from cache
    [ ] prevent generating duplicate seed when one is in process of being created but not yet created (multiple threads trying to make the same data)
    [ ] clean up
    [ ] bug: when play with generation settings in TestNoiseScreen, seems to effect map/tile generation in game






[ ] take care of some of the todo's
    there is so much to do, and I keep adding more...


[ ] fixed time step (necessary for multiplayer?)

    http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html

[ ] fix floating point errors in deep space caused by large world coordinates and small frame times is affecting movement physics: epsilon / truncating errors

[...] rendering system
    [...] fix stuff moving ahead of camera
        [x] ship - fixed
        [ ] player - still jumps ahead of camera
        [x] shaperenderer - shield moves ahead of camera
        [ ] projectiles from ship - moves ahead of ship
    [...] fix render priority (z-order)
          [X] moved into separate variable
          [ ] define proper heights for importance as current values are somewhat arbitrary
          [ ] this is now a bit more complex, as there is a mix of 2d sprites and 3d renderables, that are rendered in separate batches (2d then 3d overlaye).
              to mix the z between them may require multiple batch passes, or migrating to 3d, also shaperenderer on top of that...
    [ ] should consider merging SpaceRenderingSystem & WorldRenderingSystem because they are basically duplicates which the difference of background tiles
        or at least have them share rendering functions as the drawEntities() & draw3DRenderables() are identical between them


[ ] fix space parallax system, generating pixmaps on the fly is slow, try to replace with shader



---GAMEPLAY & DESIGN---
[...] SHIPS
    [...] COMBAT
        [...] 3D roll animation for dodge / barrel roll
                [x] fix 3D texture test
                [x] integrate
                [ ] lock orientation and changes to velocity
                [...] scale bounding box during rotation
                [...] fix take off and landing shrink/grow animation
                    [x] fix crash
                    [...] sometimes model doesn't shrink, and never grows
                [ ] should use native texture size then scale the model instead?
                [ ] clean up: should move values to config
                [ ] clean up: optimize rendering -> ModelCache
                [ ] clean up: ensure proper disposal
                [x] lock facing orientation while rolling, looks funny
                [ ] mobile/touch UI way of activating dodge, a swipe on the joystick may be intuitive
        [x] shield
        [ ] bullet come from gun rather than magically from ship
        [ ] weapon types
            [x] basic cannon
            [...] grow cannon shoot circles/rectangles with radius relative to damage "weight" of projectile (damage = size * velocity * typeMultiplier)?
            [ ] L cannon, touhou style multiple bullet cannon
            [ ] Laser cannon
    [ ] engine mode:
            [x] local/combat (slow, for interacting with object near, landing planets, fighting)
            [ ] travel/cruise (medium, for navigating within a system, planet to planet, avoid/escape, faster travel)
            [ ] hyper/warp   (fast, warp to other systems, can't turn, can't fight)

    [ ] ship generation
        [ ] fix ship edges to use entire width of texture
	    [...] wings
	    [ ] engines
	    [ ] weapons
	    [ ] details: eg: lines, another layer on top for depth/windshield type thing, different stuff on underside of sprite
	    [ ] generation styles and classes, perhaps come up with some kind of classes of ships (cargo, highspeed traveler, tank/war machine, passenger, personal, commercial...)
