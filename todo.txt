[x] fix land/take-off position bug
	[...] test land AI, system doesn't supports non-player world switching
		consider what to keep track of between planet and space
		-what data to keep and discard between screens
		-AI to remember (persistence)
[...] wrap planets properly (LOCAL COORDINATE SPACE)
[ ] time based orbit
[ ] fixed time step (necessary for multiplayer?)
	https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/
[ ] timer object
[ ] fix floating point errors in deep space caused by large world coordinates and small frame times is affecting movement physics: epsilon / truncating errors
	https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/dont-store-that-in-a-float/
[ ] fix render priority (z-order)
[ ] system processing priority
[ ] make colored tiles use texture regions instead of individual textures. (create one texture with all colors/tiles on it)
[ ] fix ship edges to use entire width of texture
[ ] try setting camera rotate to player orientation?
[ ] pause/menu
[ ] simple scripting? text file of commands for creating entities and printing story text?
[ ] multiplayer/networking...or just commit suicide
[ ] convert all uses of shaperenderer to spritebatch? (would this increase performance?)

---DEBUG---
[ ] in game console
[ ] messages/info/log
[ ] commands
[ ] cleanup debug UI (component list)
[ ] change menu to interactive options (like gta native trainer) instead of static hotkeys 
	5 - select
	8 - up
	4 - left
	6 - right
	2 - down
	0 - back


---MOBILE---
[ ] if player bounds overlap vehicle, show enter button on touchUI/hud
[ ] if in vehicle show exit button (if can get out? must be over platform/spacestation? jetpack?)
[ ] pinch-pull to zoom in-out on touch
[ ] test touchUI on different screen sizes/resolutions
[ ] set engine speed max to multiplier on android

---GAMEPLAY & DESIGN---
[ ] destructable(voronoi) asteroids

	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20104779/libgdx-create-texture-from-overlay-using-pixmap
[ ] combat system
	create types, (normal, red, green, blue)?
	shoot circles/rectangles with radius relative to damage "weight" of projectile (damage = size * velocity * typeMultiplier)?
	dodge [Left][Right] (double tap) - move fast to left or right
	shield [SHIFT] - ring around ship
	add side to side dodge (jump/burst) [LEFT]/[RIGHT]
[ ] ship generation
	wings, engines, weapons, another layer on top for depth/windshield type thing
	look at some different types of ships like an 'H' ,etc...
	perhaps come up with some kind of classes of ships (cargo, highspeed traveler, tank/war machine, passenger, personal, commercial...)
		engine mode:
			-combat (slow, for interacting with object near, landing planets, fighting)
			-cruise (medium, for navigating within a system, planet to planet, avoid/escape, faster travel)
			-warp   (fast, warp to other systems, can't turn, can't fight)
[ ] planet generation
	research planet attributes //size, temperature, pressure, atmosphere, elements...etc
	rings around planets? (like saturn)
	moons/satelites
