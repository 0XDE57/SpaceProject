# a space project
Welcome to A Space Project. A project involving space...duh.
* Enjoy Galactic Space Exploration in a sate-of-the-art, hyper-realistic physics simulation of the entire universe!
* Get a realistic sense of the cosmic scale; there's literally dozens of planets and traveling between them could take up to minutes!
* You want Faster Than Light Travel, you got it. (yeah it's real bro cuz like quantum anti-dark matter n' stuff yo)
* During your explorations you could find various astronomical bodies including:
    * Unique planetary systems
    * Binary star systems, Trinary star systems, and even quadri... quatro? quadrino-ary? f**k it, as-many-as-you-want star systems!
    * Discover lonely rogue planets who lost their son. :(
* Pilot different spaceships and combat dumb AI written by an even dumber human ;)
* Then when your bored of that sh*t you can land on a planet I guess. The worlds are flat (Ha! take that round Earthers)

Ok, seriously: The are two main views. Space & World.
Space is a finite galaxy, generated by a set of points. Each point is a collection of stars and/or planets.
Worlds are also finite. If you move continuously in one direction you will eventually return to where you started. Wrapped via a 4D torus.

This game is still in alpha phase and suffers severe feature creep. There's not much content yet but I have plans. Stay tuned.

## Current Status
Work in progress. Currently in early development. More of an engine than a game at this point as there is not much content, just scaffolding for what will hopefully one day be a game. The code is bit rough in some places, littered with todo's, half-baked features, and of course the occasional bug. Also, forgive my programmer graphics.

Actively...and painfully slowly...in progress... It doesn't even have sound and I have been poking at this for over 6 years now... Oh well. For what I am currently working on and just general notes to myself see [todo.txt](https://github.com/0XDE57/SpaceProject/blob/master/todo.txt)

## Building
**General**
* Set up your [Development Environment](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/documentation/gettingstarted/Setting%20Up.html)
* Make sure Android SDK is installed.
* Import project in IDE of choice using gradle.
* If a "File not found" error occurs, check the working directory. Append "android\assets" to the working directory in run configurations.


**Android Studio**
* Desktop
  * create Run Configuration
  * main class = com.spaceproject.desktop.DesktopLauncher
  * use classpath of module 'desktop'
  * working directory = ...\SpaceProject\android\assets
  * (must ensure working directory includes assets so data like fonts and configs can be loaded)
  * build and run!
* Android
  * enable dev options, enable usb debugging
  * connect phone, android studio should detect it
  * build and run!
* IOS
  * dunno fam, this shits broken for me currently. something about a provisioner ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
