# a space project
Welcome to A Space Project. A project involving space...
> Enjoy Galactic Space Exploration in a sate-of-the-art, hyper-realistic physics simulation of the entire universe!

> Get a realistic sense of the cosmic scale; there's literally dozens of planets and traveling between them could take up to entire minutes!

***Game is in pre-alpha prototype phase. More of a sandbox than a game, there is not much content yet***

## Features
* Fly around the starsystem in a spaceship
* Faster Than Light Travel! (yeah it's real, cuz like quantum anti-dark matter n' stuff yo)
* Discover a plethora of astronomical bodies including:
    * Destructible asteroids using cutting edge - ***t r i â–² n g l e s*** -
    * Unary star systems, Binary star systems, Trinary star systems, and even ~~Quadri... quatro? quadrino-ary?~~
    * lonely rogue planets who lost their sun :(
* Fight against other ship (disabled for now)
  * combat broken placeholder AI while I figure out the rest of the engine.
* Land on and explore planets (in theory, probably out of scope):
   * The planets are flat (ha, take that Round Earthers!)
      * Actually the planets are ***donuts*** (ha, take that Flat Earthers!)
* Controller Support (works in game but not menus)
   * hot plugging!
* Sound?
  * there is no sound in the vacuum of space silly
* Unit Tests?
   * pfft... my code is perfect. the first time. every time.
* Developer Tools (in progress)
* Cross-Platform Desktop and Mobile Support
  * Windows, OSX, Linux, Android, IOS
  * (it may be difficult to find sensible touchscreen controls, focus is desktop and controller)
* Feature Creep and Unrealistic Scope!
   * Multiplayer is out of current scope :(

## Current Status
A work in progress engine toy sandbox thing: scaffolding for what will hopefully one day be a game.
The code is bit rough in some places, littered with todo's, half-baked features, and the occasional bug.

## Building
**General**
* Set up your Development Environment: https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/setup
* Make sure Android SDK is installed.
* Import project in IDE of choice using gradle.
* If a "File not found" error occurs, check the working directory. Append "\assets" to the working directory in run configurations.


**IntelliJ / Android Studio**
* Desktop
  * create Run Configuration
  * main class = com.spaceproject.desktop.DesktopLauncher
  * use classpath of module 'desktop'
  * working directory = ...\SpaceProject\assets
      * (must ensure working directory includes assets so data like fonts, particles, shaders, configs can be loaded)
  * build and run!
* Android
  * enable dev options, enable usb debugging
  * connect phone, android studio should detect it
  * build and run!
* IOS
  * https://libgdx.com/dev/import_and_running/#ios
