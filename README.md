# a space project
Welcome to A Space Project. A project involving space...
> Get a realistic sense of the cosmic scale; there's literally dozens of planets and traveling between them could take up to entire minutes! Enjoy Galactic Space Exploration in a sate-of-the-art, hyper-realistic physics simulation of the entire universe!

***Game is in pre-alpha prototype phase. More of a sandbox than a game, there is not much content yet***

## Features
* Fly around the star system in a spaceship
* Discover a plethora of astronomical bodies including:
    * Unary star systems, Binary star systems, Trinary star systems, and even ~~Quadri... quatro? quadrino-ary?~~
    * lonely rogue planets who lost their sun :(
    * Destructible asteroids using cutting edge - ***t r i ▲ n g l e s*** -
* Mine asteroids for resources. Upgrade ship.
* Faster Than Light Travel! (yeah it's real, cuz like quantum anti-dark matter n' stuff yo)
* ~~Fight against other ship~~ (disabled for now)
  * combat broken placeholder AI while I figure out the rest of the engine.
* Land on and explore finite (toroidally wrapped) planets (in theory, probably out of scope).
* Controller Support (works in game but not all menus)
   * hot plugging!
* Sound?
  * there is no sound in the vacuum of space silly
* ~~Unit Tests~~
   * pfft... my code is perfect. the first time. every time.
* Developer Tools (in progress)
* Cross-Platform Desktop
  * Linux, Windows, OSX
  * Official Steam Deck support!
* Feature Creep and Unrealistic Scope!
   * Multiplayer is out of current scope :(

## Current Status
A work in progress engine toy sandbox thing: scaffolding for what will hopefully one day be a game.
The code is bit rough in some places, littered with todo's, half-baked features, and the occasional bug.

## Building
**General**
* Set up your Development Environment: https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/setup
* Import project in IDE of choice using gradle.
* If a "File not found" error occurs, check the working directory. Append "\assets" to the working directory in run configurations.


**IntelliJ**
* Desktop
  * create Run Configuration
  * main class = com.spaceproject.desktop.DesktopLauncher
  * use classpath of module 'desktop'
  * working directory = ...\SpaceProject\assets
      * (must ensure working directory includes assets so data like fonts, particles, shaders, configs can be loaded)
  * build and run!
