/**
 *            Colour Rendering of Spectra
 *
 *                    by John Walker
 *               http://www.fourmilab.ch/
 *
 *              Last updated: March 9, 2003
 *
 *        This program is in the public domain.
 *
 * For complete information about the techniques employed in
 * this program, see the World-Wide Web document:
 *
 *          http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/specrend/
 *
 * The xyz_to_rgb() function, which was wrong in the original
 * version of this program, was corrected by:
 *
 *         Andrew J. S. Hamilton 21 May 1999
 *         Andrew.Hamilton@Colorado.EDU
 *         http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/
 *
 * who also added the gamma correction facilities and
 * modified constrain_rgb() to work by desaturating the
 * colour by adding white.
 *
 * A program which uses these functions to plot CIE
 * "tongue" diagrams called "ppmcie" is included in
 * the Netpbm graphics toolkit:
 *     http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/
 * (The program was called cietoppm in earlier
 *     versions of Netpbm.)
 *
 *
 *  -------------------------------------------
 *  ported from C to Java, with some minor tweaks to fit the engine and style.
